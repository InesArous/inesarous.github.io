# Brief Bio
I am a researcher focused on advancing human-centered natural language processing (NLP) models that are explainable and effective. As a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/) and McGill University, I work with [Prof. Jackie C.K. Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/) on optimizing the usage of human feedback in language models. My work focuses on designing frameworks that leverage human intelligence to enhance NLP models and tailoring them for applications with significant societal impact. I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Fribourg under the supervision of [Prof. Philippe Cudr√©-Mauroux](https://exascale.info/phil/), specializing in human-AI collaborative approaches for data curation. I developed hybrid human-AI approaches for data collection, evaluation, and model explanation. My work has been accepted and presented at top conferences, including the Web Conference, AAAI, and ACL. During my doctoral studies, I completed an internship at Alexa Shopping, [Amazon Research](https://www.amazon.science/).


My research interests lie at the intersection of human computation and Natural Language Processing. I aim to develop human-centered NLP models that are trustworthy, controllable, and effective.
